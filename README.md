# GUI-Bank-Management-System

The program is about creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a bank card system, using JAVA libraries such as Swing and Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) to provide user a visual experience while keeping the functionality intact.
The GUI has 3 tabs, namely personal details, debit card, and credit card. A text field is 
provided on every tab that allows the user to input the values. On a debit card section, 
after filling the text field, user can add their debit card, withdraw the amount from the bank,
and check their current amount after withdrawal from the respective button. Similarly, on 
the credit card section, user can add their credit card, set their credit limit, cancel their 
credit card and check their current status from the respective button. 

The program also uses the concept of arraylist to store the object of debit and credit card,
implements the upcasting and downcasting concept to access methods from specific 
classes.
